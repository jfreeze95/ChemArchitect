## Welcome to ChemArchitect!

The purpose of ChemArchitect is to overcome the nightmare of data generation for chemical application and machine learning. Whether you want need automatic generation of all permutations of ligand substitutions, input files for ab initio calculations, extraction of chemical parameters from calculation output files, or more, ChemArchitect seeks to ease your exploration of massive chemical space. All current features can be found on the [features]() page.

### What's New!

ChemArchitect launches! All aspects of the program should be as genralized as possible for the launch, with specific user inputs specified and detailed [here](). Check out the [Getting Started] page for installation instructions, and read the [Documentation] for step-by-step instructions and tutorials.

### Coming in the Future!

ChemArchitect plans to expand as a chemical generation and machine learning tool. If you have ideas for feature additions, please email the head architect [here]().
