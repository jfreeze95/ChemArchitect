<h1>Getting Started</h1>

The current setup assumes you are using Gaussian files. Future features may include options for all major file input types. Make a request to speed up the code for your favorite file type.

<h2>Installation</h2>

If you are unfamiliar with installation of programs using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these utilities first.
