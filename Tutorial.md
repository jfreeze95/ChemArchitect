<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
ChemArchItect is a software package designed to make the dataset generation of computational chemical data easier for those wishing to utilize machine learning for chemistry. Included therefore, are programs to generate initial structures, create input files for ab initio software, sub-divide your dataset, prepare files for submission and resubmission, and extract features and outputs from input and output files. All of these files will be outlined in this tutorial, with detailing of dependences and potential improvements/limitations of the code. As with any codebase, development and collaboration is encouraged. If anyone wishes to add to the ChemArchItect package, please utilize the standard Github features do so.

<h2>Making Many Gaussian Input Files From a List of SMILES.</h2>
In this section it is detailed how to take a list of SMILES molecules and make Gaussian input files that are ready to be submitted. First and foremost, a SMILES molecule is a way to describe a molecule in a one-dimensional string. While the three dimensional representations generated from SMILES structures may be slightly different depending on the table of bond lengths the 1D-3D generator is using, the SMILES format remains a compact and reliable way to communicate and generate molecular structure. An example of SMILES being converted to 3D is shown in Figure 1.

If you do not yet have a list of SMILES formatted molecules, you can obtain them from various repositories and papers. For this tutorial we are taking a dataset of 14,641 quaternary carbon type molecules that have been substituted with the ligands [H,CH<sub>3</sub>,OCH<sub>3</sub>,SCH<sub>3</sub>,I,Br,Cl,F,C&equiv;N,Si<sub>3</sub>,BO<sub>2</sub>]. These strings were generated by permuting all possible ligand substitutions on a central quaternary carbon. These molecules are all organic, but due to the locations of some of the halides on the periodic table, the choice of basis set should be considered carefully to ensure the treatment of electrons is linear as the element size increases. This can be a problem for Popel basis sets which around Br stop treating electrons (core and valence) equally to save on computational cost [cite](). This matters for machine learning applications because while the theory of machine learning states that neural networks are universal function machines that can in an infinite limit of model size find any function, computational tractability on the model and dataset acquisition sides remain key blockades that should be avoided if possible. Additionally, having simple models, especially linear models, lend towards easier determination of new chemical understanding due to the simplicity of analyzing the resulting coefficients trained by the model. Therefore, in all aspects of dataset generation and representaiton, the complexity that is inherently encoded into the data much be considered.
<br><br>
Make sure the dataset file smiles_gen_full_quaternaryCarbon.txt is in the same directory as SmileToMol.py, or that you know the path to access it from. A smaller test file is also available under the name SmileToMol_tester.txt. Open a terminal and run:<br>
      
      
    python SmileToMol.py

<br>
You may need to give it permissions first by running the command:<br>
      
      
    chmod +x SmileToMol.py
      
<br>
Follow the prompts to enter the number of files you would like to convert, and the name of the file with extension. <br><br>
Be aware that the number of files selects files in the order they are in the file so if you desire a random selection of files from your full list then you will need to use RandInputSelect.py, which will be explained shortly, first. The number of files is also important for alerting you from the beginning how much space you are about to take up on your computer, which is an important warning to prevent computer bricking (ie filling up your hard disk so that it cannot operate or boot). There are a multitude of unit conversion calculators online if you are unfamiliar with the byte unit. If the size the program mentions during its pause is too big, then you can stop the program with ctrl+c.
<br><br>
  Upon hitting enter, the program will convert all of your SMILES strings into .mol formatted files. If you are aware of the fact that OpenBabel also has this capability and wondering why we do not use that utility for this step, please refer to the [justifications](https://jfreeze95.github.io/ChemArchitect/Justification) section. Note that if you run the program again, the files will be overwritten if they have the same name.
 <br><br>
Congratulations! You now have files in the mol specification!
<br><br>
      <h2>Converting .mol to .gjf or .com with OBabel</h2><br>
The next step is to convert your .mol files into .gjf or .com files so they may be read by Gaussian. This can be done very simply by executing the following command in a terminal that is located in the same directory as your mol files:
      
      
      obabel -m -imol *.mol -ogjf *.gjf
      
      
This command:<br>
      1. Calls the obabel program <br>
      2. Requests the operation be performed for multiple files with the -m tag<br>
      3. Says the input format with be mol. (Input formats follow the syntax i<extension>)<br>
      4. Says to do this to all files in the directory with a .mol extension (* is a wildcard that means I don't care what comes before)<br>
      5. Says the output format with be gjf. (for com use -ocom)<br>
      4. Says all files being converted should take whatever name came before the old extension and just tak on the new extension.<br>
<br>
This may take a bit of time to execute the command on all files. Be aware of any warnings as they may require troubleshooting. Most often the troubleshooting is generally because you had a malformed file from some bad or poorly interpreted SMILES string. Standard output looks something linke this:

Now you have successfully made files structured for Gaussian input.
