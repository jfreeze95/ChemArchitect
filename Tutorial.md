<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
ChemArchItect is a software package designed to make the dataset generation of computational chemical data easier for those wishing to utilize machine learning for chemistry. Included therefore, are programs to generate initial structures, create input files for ab initio software, sub-divide your dataset, prepare files for submission and resubmission, and extract features and outputs from input and output files. All of these files will be outlined in this tutorial, with detailing of dependences and potential improvements/limitations of the code. As with any codebase, development and collaboration is encouraged. If anyone wishes to add to the ChemArchItect package, please utilize the standard Github features do so.

<h2>Making Many Gaussian Input Files From a List of SMILES.</h2>
In this section it is detailed how to take a list of SMILES molecules and make Gaussian input files that are ready to be submitted. First and foremost, a SMILES molecule is a way to describe a molecule in a one-dimensional string. While the three dimensional representations generated from SMILES structures may be slightly different depending on the table of bond lengths the 1D-3D generator is using, the SMILES format remains a compact and reliable way to communicate and generate molecular structure. An example of SMILES being converted to 3D is shown in Figure 1.

If you do not yet have a list of SMILES formatted molecules, you can obtain them from various repositories and papers. For this tutorial we are taking a dataset of 14,641 quaternary carbon type molecules that have been substituted with the ligands [H,CH<sub>3</sub>,OCH<sub>3</sub>,SCH<sub>3</sub>,I,Br,Cl,F,C&equiv;N,Si<sub>3</sub>,BO<sub>2</sub>]. These strings were generated by permuting all possible ligand substitutions on a central quaternary carbon. These molecules are all organic, but due to the locations of some of the halides on the periodic table, the choice of basis set should be considered carefully to ensure the treatment of electrons is linear as the element size increases. This can be a problem for Popel basis sets which around Br stop treating electrons (core and valence) equally to save on computational cost [cite](). This matters for machine learning applications because while the theory of machine learning states that neural networks are universal function machines that can in an infinite limit of model size find any function, computational tractability on the model and dataset acquisition sides remain key blockades that should be avoided if possible. Additionally, having simple models, especially linear models, lend towards easier determination of new chemical understanding due to the simplicity of analyzing the resulting coefficients trained by the model. Therefore, in all aspects of dataset generation and representaiton, the complexity that is inherently encoded into the data much be considered.
